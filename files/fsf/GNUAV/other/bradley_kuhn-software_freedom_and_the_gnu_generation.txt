In this speech, Brad Kuhn, executive director of the Free Software Foundation, talks about his beginnings in the free software movement and gives concrete examples from his experience as being a proprietary software developer as to why free software is a far better way to make and sell software. It should be considered a excellent introduction to Free Software. In the question and answer segment, Mr. Kuhn discusses with the audience far ranging topics that effect the future of the industry such as the SCO vs. IBM Lawsuit, File Formats, and the DMCA. This speech was presented by the Free Software Society, a student organization at the University of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign dedicated to the promotion of Free Software
