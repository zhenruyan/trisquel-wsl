The University of Costumed Heroes is an animated video telling the
story of a group of heroes falling prey to the powers of proprietary
software in education.  The university board acquires cutting-edge
remote learning software that enables them to continue their
operations online, but -- [SPOILER ALERT] -- it may sow the seeds of
their downfall.
