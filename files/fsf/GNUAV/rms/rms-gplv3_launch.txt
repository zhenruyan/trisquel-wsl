On June 29, 2007, free software supporters gathered at the Free Software
Foundation office in Boston, Massachusetts to hear Richard Stallman announce
the official release of the GNU General Public License, version 3.

We've made a video available of this announcement. You can watch Stallman give
an overview of the major changes in the license, and his reflections on the
drafting process.

The video is Ogg Theora, and is about fifteen minutes long. Please download it
