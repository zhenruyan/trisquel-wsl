You should have space on your hard disk to create a new disk partition
of at least 2 gigabytes to install a standard Trisquel desktop system or
at least 400 megabytes for a minimal server installation. You'll need
more disk space to install additional packages, depending on what you
wish to do with your new Trisquel system.
